# 42_Fract-ol

# Summary
Fractol is a 42 Project aimed at exploring fractals; mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern unlimited displayed at every scale.

#Keys
* mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer).
* moving fractals with the arrows.
* Pressing *asterisk* increase max iteraction and *division* decrease it.
* *+* and *-* increase or decrease a variable to iteract and perform differents julia's sets.
# Steps:

1. Make:
![](/img/make.png?raw=true "shot1")
	See fractols avaliables:
![](/img/fractol.png?raw=true "shot1")
2. Exect ./fractol with the parametre that u want to seee: <br />

#Mandelbrot:
![](/img/mandel1.png?raw=true "shot1")
![](/img/mandel2.png?raw=true "shot1")

#julia:
![](/img/julia1.png?raw=true "shot1")
![](/img/julia2.png?raw=true "shot1")

#ship:
![](/img/ship1.png?raw=true "shot1")
![](/img/ship2.png?raw=true "shot1")
